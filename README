The IOB Package
===============
FCLA's inout board or torture? Is there a difference?

From the command line
=====================
% iob --help for more info

Running with iChat
==================
The ichat_sync program will synchronize iChat's current status with the IOB. 
Currently there is no support for status messages. There is simple output for
normal use and errors are written to standard error.

a good way to run this is with a cronjob (example runs every 10 minues)
*/10 * * * *       python $HOME/Code/iob/ichat >> $HOME/.iob.log 2>&1

Running with Purple Clients (Pidgin, Fintch)
============================================
The purle_listener program listens for purple clients to change status. Status
messages are passed along to the IOB. There is simple output for normal use and
errors are written to standard error.

To run it inthe background with the output logged:
% ./purple_listener >> $HOME/.iob.log 2>&1 &

It will print some startup stuff and notification changes, you can safely run
it in the background.
