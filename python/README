The IOB Package
===============
FCLA's inout board or torture? Is there a difference?

From the command line
=====================
% iob --help for more info

Running with iChat
==================
with iob instanned run iobSync to keep the in/out board in sync with iChat

Running with Purple Clients (Pidgin, Fintch)
============================================
The purle_listener program listens for purple clients to change status. Status
messages are passed along to the IOB. There is simple output for normal use and
errors are written to standard error.

To run it inthe background with the output logged:
% ./purple_listener >> $HOME/.iob.log 2>&1 &

It will print some startup stuff and notification changes, you can safely run
it in the background.
