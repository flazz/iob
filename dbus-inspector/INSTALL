You need the following dependencies:
Python (2.3 should be sufficient, but tested only with 2.4)
PyGTK
Python DBus bindings (Tested: 0.70, recommended: 0.80+)

On a Debian system, you can satisfy these dependencies by running
apt-get install python-dbus python-glade2

To run DBus inspector, execute "dbus-inspector"
