Changes:

Version 0.2.1:
- make toolbar buttons "important" so their label is displayed, too.
- try harder to locate the glade file

Version 0.2:
- removed elementtree dependency, using xml.dom.minidom now, which is included
in regular Python
- refactored code
- support for arguments and signals
- added third pane to the view

TODO / Wishlist:
- properties and annotations - are they supported by the python dbus bindings?
Or is just none of my DBus enabled applications using them so far?

- parse and handle type signatures (for method/signal arguments)

- UI for executing methods

- UI for monitoring signals

- Likely to become a separate project:
UI to setup listeners for signals, e.g. to start a VPN client upon connecting
to some wireless network identified via it's SSID etc.
